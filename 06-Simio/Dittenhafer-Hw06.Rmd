# 1) Drivers License Facility Simulation

## a) Home many 'source', 'server', 'sink' do we need to develop this model, what do those objects stand for in the real system?

* We need 1 **source**.
* 3 **servers**
* 1 **sink**

The source, named *SrcApplicantArrives* in my model, effectively represents the front door of the driver's license facility in this model. It generates the arrival events for the applicant entity.

The servers, named *SvrCheckin*, *SvrExamClerks* and *SvrCheckout* in my model, represent the check clerk, exam clerks and checkout computers, respectively.

The sink, named SnkApplicantDeparts, represents the exit door which enables the applicants to leave after they are done.

## b) Simio Model Screenshots

The screenshots of my model in Simio follow:

### SrcApplicantArrives Properties

I chose to use the exponential distribution for interarrival time since the question stated "approximately 10/hour" as opposed to "exactly"" 10/hour.

### SvrCheckin Properties

For the checkin processing time, I chose to use the normal distribution with a mean of 5 minutes and standard deviation of 1 minute. Again, my rationale was that the question write stated "approximately 5 minutes".

## c) Run the model and obtain the performance measures...

I set the simulation to run for 8 hours based on the concept of a business day. I created an Experiment with 10 Replications which was run to generate the following performance results:

## d) Adding an optional "computerized exam kiosk"
